# Requirements Document

## Introduction

TalkToMachine is a full-stack MERN platform that provides AI-powered multilingual chat capabilities with Tanglish (Tamil-English) support, document ingestion with semantic search, intent classification, risk assessment, speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and comprehensive admin dashboards. The system serves enterprises with role-based access control, real-time notifications, and comprehensive logging for queries and alerts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an operator, I want to submit text or audio queries to the AI system, so that I can receive intelligent responses with appropriate language detection and risk assessment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an operator submits a text query THEN the system SHALL detect the language (including Tanglish) and process the query through the AI pipeline
2. WHEN an operator submits an audio query THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text using offline STT before processing
3. WHEN a query is processed THEN the system SHALL classify intent with confidence score and assess risk level
4. IF the risk level exceeds the configured threshold THEN the system SHALL block the query and log an alert
5. WHEN a query is successfully processed THEN the system SHALL generate a response and convert it to audio using offline TTS
6. WHEN any query is processed THEN the system SHALL log the interaction with all metadata for audit purposes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an enterprise admin, I want to upload and manage documents (PDF/DOC/DOCX), so that the AI system can perform semantic search and provide contextual responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin uploads a document THEN the system SHALL validate file type and size (â‰¤10MB per file)
2. WHEN a valid document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text content and chunk it appropriately
3. WHEN document chunks are created THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings using local transformer models
4. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store documents, chunks, and vectors in the database
5. WHEN semantic search is performed THEN the system SHALL use cosine similarity to find relevant chunks
6. WHEN document processing is complete THEN the system SHALL return indexing statistics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an enterprise admin, I want to view and manage query logs and alerts, so that I can monitor system usage and respond to high-risk situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display recent queries with pagination
2. WHEN an admin views query details THEN the system SHALL show intent classification, risk level, and response metadata
3. WHEN high-risk queries are blocked THEN the system SHALL create alerts and notify admins via push notifications
4. WHEN an admin views alerts THEN the system SHALL display alert details with enterprise and operator context
5. WHEN an admin deletes queries or alerts THEN the system SHALL remove them from the database
6. WHEN alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL send FCM push notifications to registered admin devices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a super admin, I want to manage enterprises and assign enterprise admins, so that I can control system access and organization structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a super admin creates an enterprise THEN the system SHALL generate a unique enterprise ID and store enterprise details
2. WHEN a super admin assigns an admin role THEN the system SHALL update user permissions for the specified enterprise
3. WHEN role assignments are made THEN the system SHALL validate super admin permissions before allowing changes
4. WHEN enterprise management actions occur THEN the system SHALL log administrative changes for audit purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to support multiple languages with Tanglish detection, so that users can interact naturally in their preferred language mix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text contains Tamil Unicode characters mixed with Latin script THEN the system SHALL detect it as Tanglish
2. WHEN language detection is uncertain THEN the system SHALL use fallback detection libraries (franc/cld3)
3. WHEN Tanglish is detected THEN the system SHALL map responses to Tamil voice for TTS output
4. WHEN intent classification occurs THEN the system SHALL support multilingual examples and responses
5. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate language-specific content

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust authentication and authorization, so that access is properly controlled across different user roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL require Firebase Auth for all protected endpoints
2. WHEN in development mode with ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true THEN the system SHALL accept X-Debug-Role header for testing
3. WHEN users access resources THEN the system SHALL validate role permissions (operator, enterprise_admin, super_admin)
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
5. WHEN FCM tokens are registered THEN the system SHALL associate them with user accounts and enterprises

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive health monitoring and rate limiting, so that the system remains stable and performs reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health checks are requested THEN the system SHALL report status of all services (API, embeddings, vector store, Firebase, STT, TTS)
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL reject requests with appropriate error messages
3. WHEN query endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limits (e.g., 30/min per enterprise)
4. WHEN upload endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL enforce stricter rate limits (e.g., 5/min)
5. WHEN TTS requests are made THEN the system SHALL cache outputs using LRU strategy to improve performance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and documentation, so that the system is maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are run THEN the system SHALL test intent classification, language detection, chunking, and risk logic
2. WHEN integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL test complete API workflows including query processing and document upload
3. WHEN API documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI specification with interactive UI
4. WHEN TypeScript client is generated THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe API access for the frontend
5. WHEN test mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL use deterministic mocks for STT and TTS services
