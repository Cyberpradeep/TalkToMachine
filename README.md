**AI-Powered Vernacular Voice + Text Assistant for MSME Machine Operators**

An intelligent assistant that helps machine operators communicate with their equipment through voice and text in local languages, featuring real- 

## 🎯 Overview

TalkToMachine bridges the communication gap between MSME machine operators and technical documentation by providing an AI assistant that understands queries in local languages, searches through machine manuals, and responds with actionable guidance - all through voice and text interfaces.

### 🎪 **Demo Features**
- 🎤 **Voice Input**: Speak your questions in your local language
- 🧠 **Smart Search**: AI searches through uploaded machine manuals and FAQs
- 🗣️ **Voice Response**: Get answers back in both text and voice
- ⚠️ **Critical Issue Detection**: Automatic warnings for dangerous situations
- 🔔 **Real-time Alerts**: Instant notifications to supervisors for critical issues

---

## 🚀 Core Features

### 👷 **Operator App** (Web + Mobile-friendly)
- **Multi-input Support**: Voice (speech-to-text) and text input
- **Machine Query Processing**: Ask about operations, troubleshooting, or handling procedures
- **AI-Powered Search**: Uses LangChain + FAISS to search uploaded manuals and FAQs
- **Multilingual Response**: Answers in local language with both text and voice (TTS)
- **Safety First**: Critical issue detection shows warnings and alerts administrators

### 👨‍💼 **Admin Dashboard**
- **Document Management**: Upload machine manuals, SOPs, troubleshooting guides (PDF, DOC, text, images)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: View all operator queries as they happen
- **Instant Notifications**: Get notified via Firebase Cloud Messaging or email
- **Query Analytics**: View logs of past queries with deletion control

### 🏢 **Super Admin** (Enterprise Level)
- **Multi-Enterprise Management**: Oversee multiple enterprises from one dashboard
- **Admin Control**: Add/remove enterprise administrators
- **Usage Analytics**: High-level usage data and insights

### 🎛️ **Enterprise Admin**
- **Operator Management**: Add/remove operators and assign machines
- **Manual Assignment**: Control which manuals each operator can access
- **Critical Alerts**: Receive immediate notifications for high-severity issues

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Intelligence

### 🚨 **Critical Issue Detection**
- **NLP-Powered Analysis**: Uses Rasa NLU or Hugging Face models for intent classification
- **Severity Assessment**: Automatically categorizes queries as info/warning/critical
- **Safety Lockdown**: High-severity issues trigger operator action blocks and immediate admin alerts

### 🔔 **Smart Notifications**
- **Real-time Alerts**: Firebase Cloud Messaging for instant notifications
- **Categorized Alerts**: Info, Warning, and Critical severity levels
- **Multi-channel**: Email and push notifications

## 🚀 MVP Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Operator Login] --> B[Voice/Text Query]
    B --> C[AI Processing & Manual Search]
    C --> D{Severity Check}
    D -->|Normal| E[Response in Local Language]
    D -->|Critical| F[Warning + Admin Alert]
    E --> G[Text + Voice Response]
    F --> H[Operator Action Blocked]
    G --> I[Query Logged]
    H --> I
```

1. **Operator logs in** → Access granted based on assigned machines
2. **Query submitted** → Via microphone or text input
3. **AI processes** → Searches relevant manuals using semantic search
4. **Response generated** → Delivered in local language (text + voice)
5. **Safety check** → High severity = operator warned + admin alerted
6. **Admin oversight** → Can view queries and take action
7. **Enterprise management** → Super admin oversees multiple enterprises
